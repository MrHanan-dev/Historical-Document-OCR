2. If I heard that sudden death happened to
others.
Q. But especially when I thought of myself, that
death might suddenly be to myself.
Q. And could not you in time with more ease
get off the guilt of sin, than by one of these means?
I mean by some?
Here. Yes, but I for fear they were heavy bolts
of sin answered it, and then I could not think of
going back to sin. Though my mind was turned
again as I would be double tormented to go
back. But how did you think?
Q. How did you think?
Here. I thought I was accustomed
to sin, and so much so, that I must be
dreaded now. I was in dread of death.
Q. And did you endeavour to
mend?
Here. Yes, and did think myself
actually mended, and had not only
quit my previous sinning, weeping for
sin, speaking to my neighbours, but
also reading and praying, and did think myself
mended.
Q. But did you think yourself
really and truly mended?
Here. No, but I had a little
better opinion of my case than formerly
and hoped that this might do for my
salvation.
Q. How came that away, were
you not mended?
Here. There were some things
that troubled me, especially when I heard
preaching, that my righteousness would do
me no good: "For by the works of the
law shall no flesh be justified."

Hopely's account of his conversion. 167

Q. But by hearing of these things, viz. We are
unrighteous, I mean not, do we mean any more
than this, viz. when I begin to think that I do
all that my righteousness can, that I can do, and by
the works of the law, no man can be justified, &c.
I mean if one can be, we are not unrighteous.
This is a bare ability to think of this by the law,
I have thought this. It's a question you are
asking, but an opinion; what do you think?
I mean a question of what do you think of that?
Here. Yes, and this gave me this. I
had thought myself to be well, but now I did not know
it. But how did you apply this to yourself?
Q. But how did you apply this to yourself?
Here. Well, and how did you apply this to
yourself?
Here. Why, I thought that myself, I
my righteousness was good, but now I see it's good
for nothing; and I was not really and truly
mended; I should still come short of God's
commandments. But I thought myself in danger of
damnation, but how could I, so as danger of my
damnation threatened?
Q. A very good application! but what are you
not sure, I mean anything that I have told you, as
far as that?
Here. Yes, and the law of God, I mean, I was
always under the law of God, and I should still be.
I mean, I will say, that the law will do me no good.
For how can this law be, what is it?
Q. How is it possible that righteousness do
good? What is it good for?
Here. There is nothing that righteousness do
good, but an opinion that I have had. And this
I thought my righteousness was good. And this I had
thought I had.
Q. But I could tell you that righteousness is
good.
